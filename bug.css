The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.special-class div {
  color: red;
}

#special-id div {
  color: green;
}

#special-id .special-class div {
  color: purple;
}
```

In this example, the last selector (`#special-id .special-class div`) has the highest specificity because it combines ID and class selectors, making its declaration for `color` override the others.
