The solution involves understanding and leveraging CSS specificity to achieve the desired outcome. There are several approaches, including:

1. **Using !important:** While generally discouraged for maintainability reasons, `!important` can override specificity issues:

```css
div {
  color: blue !important;
}
```

2. **Improving Selector Specificity:** Instead of relying on !important, a more robust solution is to create CSS rules that have higher specificity than those they should override.

3. **Refactoring CSS:** A comprehensive solution could involve refactoring the CSS to use more semantic and specific selectors from the beginning to avoid such conflicts. This makes the code easier to read and maintain.
